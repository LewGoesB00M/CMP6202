This repository contains all work completed in the CMP6202 - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning module. 

This includes weekly lab work and Assignment 2. The labs are formatted with the original lab sheet (i.e. "Lab6") and the "Testing" file, containing code produced from live class demonstrations.

Assignment 1 is present in this repository, though it was added after completion, as it is a PowerPoint file which is not typically used with GitHub.

Assignment 2 can be found in the Assignment folder, divided across "Code" and "LaTeX" folders. The code folder contains the Jupyter notebook with the Python code used for the assignment, and the LaTeX folder contains the original TeX source files for the report and its appendices, as well as the overall compiled PDF.
In the LaTeX folder is an Images folder neatly organised into further subfolders categorising the 85 images taken for the report. Some of the images taken were not used, but still exist for evaluative purposes. Most images were directly taken from the Jupyter notebook inside of Visual Studio Code using the "Jupyter Theme Dark" colour theme.

The commit history of this repository can be viewed to see the incremental changes made on a weekly basis, starting from October 18th.
Full-time work on Assignment 2 began on December 4th, continuing to its deadline on December 20th.
