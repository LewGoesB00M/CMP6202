% Interesting trick to instead make the chapter number the letter B for this appendix.
\begingroup
\renewcommand\thechapter{B}
\titleformat{\chapter}[display]
{\normalfont\huge\bfseries}{}{20pt}{\Huge}
\setcounter{section}{0} % Set the section counter back to 0 so Appendix A doesn't interfere.

% Not in use yet, but it'd likely be best to move Section 3.1 here.
