\begin{abstract}
    Probably would benefit from an abstract. You can't really write this until the very end though,
    so return to it then. \textbf{The example work is from a previous year wherein this assessment was a group task.
    You can see that each group member developed one ML model, but you seem to be developing all of them yourself, so don't be mislead
    by the report titles only mentioning one model.}
\end{abstract}
\pagecolor{white}



Your EDA can be very extensive, and you could potentially have pages and pages and pages of it; this isn't a bad thing.
The vast majority of any ML-related work is EDA because it gives you the background information on the dataset to then apply
when training the model, such as the identification of non-numerical columns and encoding them into numerical equivalents where
possible so that they become useful training data for the model, as ML models cannot interpret strings.

% \chapter*{Notes, remove before final}
% \section{Mihai W7}
% \subsection{Overall notes - Beginning of talk}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Find a problem before a dataset (No)
%     \item Identify if said problem is regression or classification
%     \item It's hard to use a classification dataset where the target column is just a bunch of labels (???)
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item This may be in reference to Week 7's wine set where you had 7 different levels of quality but converted them to 2 for binary classification.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Examples on Moodle
%     \item Datasets on Moodle but it's almost 100\% that someone else will have used them.
%     \item I also don't know if you're even allowed to use them.
%     \item A dataset can have more than one target column (though the ones you use likely won't).
%     \item Mihai strongly warns that ML is a very iterative process, and your first attempt will probably be poor. \begin{itemize}
%         \item This is why you use \textbf{pipelines} as in CMP6230 but that's not this module.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item You will be asked questions on it in the presentation \textbf{RELATED TO WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN CLASS}, likely
%     by Mihai himself, and he is trying to catch you out.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Section 2}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item After you have an identified dataset, begin EDA.
%     \item Describe how you split the dataset into training and testing dataset.
%     \item If the machine sees the test data, it may "overfit". \begin{itemize}
%         \item You've seen this before where the line of best fit isn't really a line and just connects every single point, meaning it's 
%         really good at guessing the data it already knows but not new data. 
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item You split your data \textit{BEFORE} EDA to avoid "conceptual overfitting".
%     \item When splitting data, you need to think about data imbalance i.e. training set having too much of the one option and few of the other (too many True, not enough False).
%     \item SKLearn may try to fix that for you.
%     \item Identify outliers, missing data.
%     \item "Missing information can be information in itself". Consider the source of the data (not Kaggle but rather where the Kaggle author got it from)
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item You might be able to impute data rather than deleting it.
%         \item Conserve as much data as you can, deleting data should be a last option.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Erroneous data \begin{itemize}
%         \item Another reason why your data source is important.
%         \item Could just be mistyped, see what the erroneous data actually is to see if you can correct it.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Outliers
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Is it significant enough to remove it? Is it definitely an outlier; could it feasibly be true? (speed camera example where one guy went 30 but another went 100, but that's still plausible.)
%         \item Boxplots can identify outliers.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item If your dataset is bad, your model will be, too.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Section 3}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Identify the right algorithm. \begin{itemize}
%         \item Decision trees are good at classification.
%         \item Random forest is also used for it.
%         \item Naive Bayes and KNN work for prediction and classification.
%         \item Some of these may perform worse with higher amounts of data, look into them.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Performance won't matter a massive amount but you still need to be able to justify why it was good.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Also justify its downsides and limitations.
%         \item And the limtiations of the dataset itself.
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Section 4}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Encoding is important here because ML doesn't use text. \begin{itemize}
%         \item Side-note: Even if it does that's actually just an abstraction and it's just encoding it under the hood.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Fine-tuning \begin{itemize}
%         \item Playing around with parameters of the functions.
%         \item KNN Neighbours and such
%         \item Often comes after an initial test run
%         \item If your accuracy is really low (20\% was the example), fine-tuning won't help and you just need to redo the entire work.
%         \item Could maybe give you an extra 5\% accuracy.
%         \item Decision trees may have multiple versions. SKLearn's decision tree may be different from a CUDA one.
%     \end{itemize}

%     \item Evaluation metrics
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Accuracy is not Precision. Which do you need?
%         \item You want both to be high, if one lags massively behind the other then that's bad.
%         \item ML is an iterative process until you can get the best performing model.
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Section 5}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Visualisation of evaluation results
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item For a correlation matrix, a heatmap is better than a bar plot for example.
%         \end{itemize}
%     \end{itemize}

% Cite some academic papers to prove you're making a good case. Mihai used the 
% term "literature review", so maybe he really does mean to that depth.

% Furthermore, while it may not actually be marked, describe everything you do within the Jupyter notebook with 
% Markdown text cells. It won't count to the word count and might let you sneak in some added detail that might not 
% have been able to go in the report.

\chapter{Introduction}

% You've opened by talking about the UK but then transitioned to the whole world?
% Your datasets are American and German in origin, so it's likely that the worldwide perspective will be better.
Diabetes mellitus, or type 2 diabetes, accounts for 90\% of the 4.4 million cases of diabetes in the UK, and it is estimated that 
there are 1.2 million undiagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes across the country \autocite{diabetes_uk_how_nodate}. The rate of type 
2 diabetes per 100,000 individuals is rapidly increasing, with \textcite{khan_epidemiology_2020}'s analysis projecting that by 
2030, the rate will reach 7,079 per 100,000. Many people with diabetes suffer immensely reduced quality of life, with approximately 50\% 
of patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy \autocite{dhanapalaratnam_effect_2024}, an irreversible disability which causes immense pain due 
to nerve damage from high blood sugar \autocite{nhs_peripheral_2022}, which can occur when the patient was unaware they even 
had diabetes. 

\para
Therefore, it is imperative that systems are put in place to enable the swift diagnosis of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes 
given its major prevalence. This can be accomplished by training machine learning models on existing clinical datasets 
to identify common trends in those with and without type 2 diabetes. This report will document the planning, development 
and evaluation of multiple machine learning models in their classification of whether individuals have type 2 diabetes based 
on multiple clinical factors, specifically through the stages of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset Identification
    \item Data Integration
    \item Data Preprocessing
    \item Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    \item Model Development 
    \item Model Evaluation
    \item Research Conclusions
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset Identification}

Machine learning models require large amounts of data to train upon, meaning a dataset must be identified consisting of many 
rows and features. This project identified two datasets which could be integrated into one larger dataset, the first of which being 
the well-reputed Pima Indian Diabetes Database \autocite{uci_machine_learning_pima_nodate}, downloaded from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database}{Kaggle}, 
a platform for students and researchers alike to download and upload datasets and code for research purposes. The data originates from the National Institute 
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, who collected this data from Pima Indian\footnote{"Pima Indian" refers to a specific Native American ethnic group rather than people from India.}
women aged 21 and over in hospitals in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and it has previously seen wide use across academic literature relating to machine learning (\textcite{alzubi_diabetes_2023}, \textcite{zou_construction_2024}, \textcite{joshi_predicting_2021}, \textcite{hayashi_rule_2016}),
where other researchers have also aimed to solve the problem of diabetes classification via supervised learning. This dataset contains 768 rows with 9 features.
% Also cite Kaggle here rather than just hyperlinking it.

\para
This project also includes a second dataset, also from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndasilva/diabetes/data}{Kaggle}, that has been previously used in literature by 
\textcite{zou_construction_2024}. This dataset \autocite{john_dasilva_frankfurt_nodate} is based on data from female patients in Frankfurt, Germany, and includes the same 9 features as the Pima Indian dataset, but includes 2000 rows. By integrating these two datasets into one larger
dataset of 2768 rows, it will be possible to give the machine learning models more data to train upon.

\para Table \ref{tab:Features} details the 9 features seen in both datasets and their descriptions.
% You also need to include their types. Ordinal, nominal, etc as with CMP6230.

% An interesting statement was made by Mihai in Week 7.
% He said "You split your data BEFORE EDA to avoid conceptual overfitting".
% This probably should have been considered in the presentation slides.
% The template also is structured in a way where you split before analysis.

\section{Supervised learning task identification}
As previously mentioned, it is possible for patients to have diabetes without knowing. Therefore,
it is paramount that swift and simple diagnosis methods are put in place, which can be achieved 
through the use of supervised learning classification models. This requires the existence of the 
"ground truth", which refers to the label given to data that indicates its class \autocite{c3ai_what_nodate}. 
Within these datasets, the ground truth is present as the 'Outcome' feature, which will be used 
as the target variable for the produced classification models.
% Write more.

% RECALL VERY IMPORTANT DUE TO MEDICAL FIELD!
% SMOTE drawbacks - Synthetic data. Needs data to make more data. In the event of SEVERE imbalance
% (not like your data) it might just give noise instead of useful data.
% KNN + SMOTE - Your dataset is 50% synthetic now. Talk somewhere about the risks of that.
% You removed 98th percentile before imputing your 0s, so was it even the 98th percentile or not?
%   He either didn't notice that or thought it was the right thing to do and didn't mention it so maybe it's fine?
% Split before EDA.
% Why do we do training and testing splits? You were unable to directly answer that during the presentation.

% If you take VSCode screenshots, ensure that your IDE theme is the same across all of them.


\chapter{Exploratory Data Analysis}
This chapter details the EDA processes undertaken with the datasets, including 
key questions that will be answered by the process, as well as the splitting of the 
data into training and testing % and validation
sets.

\section{Data Integration}
% Not included in template but I feel it's necessary to include somewhere because that's what you're doing.
The two datasets must first be merged into one to allow for an overall analysis to be performed.
This is a simple process because they both contain the same 9 features, and is detailed in Figure 
\ref{fig:Integration}.

\pagebreak 

\section{Question identification and assumptions}
% What questions do you have that thorough EDA would answer?
% Example A gives a good example on what this section should look like.
The key factors involved in the diagnosis of diabetes are critical to understand, which 
can be solved through EDA on these datasets. It is possible to make various assumptions based 
on topical background research of each of the features in the dataset, detailed in Table \ref{tab:Assumptions}

\begin{longtable}{ | p{0.19\textwidth} | p{0.75\textwidth} | }
    \hline
    \cellcolor{blue!25} Feature & \cellcolor{blue!25} Research-based assumptions \\
    \hline
    Pregnancies & Approximately 13.4\% of pregnant women develop a temporary condition known as Gestational 
    Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), which typically subsides after birth \autocite{adam_pregnancy_2023}.
    However, research by \autocite{dennison_absolute_2021} indicates that 33\% of women who develop 
    GDM will go on to develop permanent diabetes mellitus within 15 years. Therefore, it is assumed 
    that pregnancies will positively correlate with the diabetes outcome. It is also expected that 
    pregnancies should naturally positively correlate with age. \\
    \hline
    Glucose & Glucose concentrations are an enormous factor in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, being one 
    of the main metrics used to certify the condition, where results over 200mg/dL mean an absolute diagnosis\footnote{The other main metric is insulin deficiency, meaning that the patient could have glucose levels lower than 200mg/dL and still be diagnosed if they are instead insulin deficient. \autocite{aftab_cloud-based_2021}.}
    \autocite{aftab_cloud-based_2021}. It is therefore assumed that the glucose concentrations will be one 
    of the strongest influences of the outcome, and that it will also correlate heavily with insulin levels. \\
    \hline
    BloodPressure & Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) does influence the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, as 
    56.2\% of recently diagnosed patients presented with elevated DBP in \textcite{nelaj_high_2023}'s limited 
    study of 126 patients, but it is not a decisive factor by itself. Therefore, it is assumed that there will 
    be some correlation between DBP and the outcome, but not as major as other factors like plasma glucose levels.\\
    \hline
    SkinThickness & It is a frequent assumption even non-academically that people who weigh more, and by consequence have higher 
    skin thickness in certain areas such as the triceps, have a higher risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes. This is 
    backed by a study by \textcite{ruiz-alejos_skinfold_2020}, which found strong associations between skin thickness and diabetes mellitus,
    as well as high blood pressure. Therefore, it is assumed that there will be a strong correlation between tricep skin thickness and the outcome, 
    as well as an expectation of strong correlations between thickness, BMI and blood pressure.\\
    \hline
    Insulin & Diabetes mellitus is directly associated with insulin deficiency, and as such, it is assumed that this factor will be 
    the strongest influence in the outcome. This is because 2-hour serum insulin tests, as used in this dataset, are frequently 
    part of HOMA-IR\footnote{Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance, used to measure insulin resistance \autocite{tahapary_challenges_2022}, which can be used in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes diagnosis \autocite{khalili_are_2023}.}
    assessments. \\
    \hline
    BMI & BMI is likely to be a significant factor in the outcome, which is backed by previous academic studies indicating that 71\% 
    of studied individuals showed increases in BMI prior to diagnosis \autocite{donnelly_trajectories_2024}. Additionally, BMI is used in insulin resistance measurement assessments,
    which are key assessments in diabetes diagnosis, meaning that it is a safe assumption that BMI will be a large factor in the outcome. \\
    \hline
    DiabetesPedigree- Function & People are more likely to develop diabetes mellitus if there is a family genetic history of the condition, though it is not 
    directly caused by any one particular gene \autocite{diabetes_uk_what_nodate}. With the pedigree function aiming 
    to quantify the inheritance probability, it can be assumed that it will likely correlate heavily with the outcome. \\
    \hline
    Age & \textcite{chackrewarthy_age_2012} studied the effects of age as a risk factor for diabetes mellitus, finding that many natural associated 
    factors of ageing including increases in body fat and decreases in lipid metabolism had considerable influence on the development of insulin 
    resistance and diabetes mellitus by consequence. Therefore, it is likely that there will be a noticeable correlation between a patient's age 
    and the outcome. 
     \\

    \cellcolor{blue!25} ID & \cellcolor{blue!25} Research-based assumptions \\

\section{Splitting the dataset}
% How was the data split?
% Why do we split? Why 80:20 as you're doing?
% Train/test? KFold?
% Maybe do train/test at first and KFold in an iterative improvement and compare the models?
% Training and testing sets are a minimum. It's possible they also want a VALIDATION set

\section{EDA process and results}

% Screenshots work for the code but maybe Minted could be good.
% Not that it's inherently necessary. Your code is expected as part of this submission.

\section{EDA conclusions}


\chapter{Experimental Design} % This may benefit from being its own .TeX file.
This chapter details the planned algorithms to be leveraged against this dataset,
as well as the metrics to evaluate them. Furthermore, the data cleaning and preprocessing 
stages will be deeply explored, as well as some potential limitations relating to their use.

\section{Identification of chosen algorithms}
% What algorithms? 
% Why those? 
% How do those algorithms work?


\section{Identification of appropriate evaluation techniques}
% What metrics?
% Why those?
% How do they show the model's performance?

\section{Data Cleaning and Pre-processing Transformations}
% What data cleaning techniques did you apply and why?
% Discuss:
%   What is data cleaning? (e.g. handling missing data)
%       Imputation via KNN will work because each missing column has a highly correlated associate. Insulin can be inferred from Glucose. SkinThickness from BMI.
%       BloodPressure can't but it's not missing too many.
%   What is data encoding? (label, one-hot)
%   What is data scaling? Why is it done?
%       KNN and SVM - Distance between points. Heavily skewed by large differences.
%   Have any further engineering techniques been applied? Dimensionality reduction?
%       Certainly not dimensionality reduction because you only have 8 features to begin with.
%   How have you handled missing data? (Imputation via KNNImputer as Zou et al. did?)

\section{Limitations and Options}
% What are the limitations of this approach?
%   The sheer amount of missing insulin data and imputation means the datasets are basically synthetic now.


\chapter{Model Development} % Titled "predictive modelling / model development" in template.
% This may benefit from being its own .TeX file.
This chapter details the training and evaluation processes of the original produced models
before any iterative improvements such as hyperparameter tuning.

\section{Predictive modelling process}
% What processes did you undertake to train the models?
%   How did you use the pre-processed data for training?
%   What parameters did you use?
%   Screenshots of code or Minted code blocks necessary.

\section{Results on seen data}
% Discuss evaluating your model on previously seen data i.e. the training set.
% Screenshots of code or Minted code blocks necessary.

\chapter{Evaluation and further improvements}
This chapter details the extensive evaluation of each model, as well as iterative improvements 
that were made to enhance their performance.
% This chapter MUST be its own .TeX file, and is the bulk of this report at first glance.
% No idea what this section entails, as the template is quite non-descript on it. (or over-descript idk)
% I believe it's about the iterative improvements to the models?


\chapter{Conclusion}
% Upon reaching this point, go back and make sure your introduction is still valid and makes sense in relation
% to the rest of the document. This was an issue in CMP6230 that you caught last-minute.

% Pay significant attention to the conclusion, especially the individual learning reflection, as Nouh mentioned 
% in previous weeks that he's starting his reading from there and it's a heavy bearing on your grade (10% so 8% overall)

\section{Summary of results}

\section{Reflection on Individual Learning}
% Nouh has previously stated he will begin here. This section could be 10% of the marks.
