	abstract = {Cardio-Vascular Diseases ({CVD}) are found to be rampant in the populace leading to fatal death. The statistics of a recent survey reports that the mortality rate is expanding due to obesity, cholesterol, high blood pressure and usage of tobacco among the people. The severity of the disease is piling up due to the above factors. Studying about the variations of these factors and their impact on {CVD} is the demand of the hour. This necessitates the usage of modern techniques to identify the disease at its outset and to aid a markdown in the mortality rate. Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining domains have a research scope with their enormous techniques that would assist in the prediction of the {CVD} priory and identify their behavioural patterns in the large volume of data. The results of these predictions will help the clinicians in decision making and early diagnosis, which would reduce the risk of patients becoming fatal. This paper compares and reports the various Classification, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep Learning models that are used for prediction of the Cardio-Vascular diseases. The survey is organized as threefold: Classification and Data Mining Techniques for {CVD}, Machine Learning Models for {CVD} and Deep Learning Models for {CVD} prediction. The performance metrics used for reporting the accuracy, the dataset used for prediction and classification, and the tools used for each category of these techniques are also compiled and reported in this survey.},

	abstract = {Brain stroke stands out as a leading cause of death, distinguishing it from common illnesses and highlighting the critical need to utilize machine learning techniques to identify symptoms. Among these techniques, the Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm emerged as the main candidate because of its optimal accuracy values. {RF} was chosen for its ensemble learning properties that optimize accuracy while simultaneously, bagging all outputs ({DT}), thus increasing its efficacy. Feature Selection, an important data analysis step, which is mainly achieved through pre-processing, aims to identify influential features and ignore less impactful features. Mutual Information serves as an important feature selection method. Specifically, the highest level of accuracy was achieved by cross-validating the test data - 10, resulting in 0.7760 without feature selection and 0.7790 with mutual information. Most of the attributes in the brain stroke dataset show relevance to the stroke disease class, but the resulting decision tree shows age as a particularly important node. So, the research results show that the selection feature (Mutual Information) can increase the accuracy of brain stroke classification, although it is not significant, namely an increase of 0.0030\%. With an increase, where there is no significant difference, it can be said that almost all the attributes contained in the brain stroke dataset used have an influence on their relevance to the stroke disease class.},

It is responsible for considerable morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. A timely diagnosis and prediction of this disease could provide patients with an opportunity to take the appropriate preventive and treatment strategies. To improve the understanding of risk factors, we predict type 2 diabetes for Pima Indian women utilizing a logistic regression model and decision tree—a machine learning algorithm. Our analysis finds five main predictors of type 2 diabetes: glucose, pregnancy, body mass index ({BMI}), diabetes pedigree function, and age. We further explore a classification tree to complement and validate our analysis. The six-fold classification tree indicates glucose, {BMI}, and age are important factors, while the ten-node tree implies glucose, {BMI}, pregnancy, diabetes pedigree function, and age as the significant predictors. Our preferred specification yields a prediction accuracy of 78.26\% and a cross-validation error rate of 21.74\%. We argue that our model can be applied to make a reasonable prediction of type 2 diabetes, and could potentially be used to complement existing preventive measures to curb the incidence of diabetes and reduce associated costs.},

However, the {ML} applications tend to be mistrusted because of their inability to show the internal decision-making process, resulting in slow uptake by end-users within certain healthcare sectors. This research delineates the use of three interpretable supervised {ML} models: Naı¨ve Bayes classiﬁer, random forest classiﬁer, and J48 decision tree models to be trained and tested using the Pima Indians diabetes dataset in R programming language. The performance of each algorithm is analyzed to determine the one with the best accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity. An assessment of the decision process is also made to improve the model. It can be concluded that a Naı¨ve Bayes model works well with a more ﬁne-tuned selection of features for binary classiﬁcation, while random forest works better with more features.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a complex disease that is increasing in prevalence around the world. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for about 90–95\% of all diagnosed adult cases of diabetes. Most present diagnostic methods for T2DM are black-box models, which are unable to provide the reasons underlying diagnosis to physicians; therefore, algorithms that can provide further insight are needed. Rule extraction can provide such explanations; however, in the medical setting, extracted rules must be not only highly accurate, but also simple and easy to understand. The Recursive-Rule {eXtraction} (Re-{RX}) algorithm is a “white-box” model that provides highly accurate classification. However, due to its recursive nature, it tends to generate more rules than other algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we propose the use of a rule extraction algorithm, Re-{RX} with J48graft, combined with sampling selection techniques (sampling Re-{RX} with J48graft) to achieve highly accurate, concise, and interpretable classification rules for the Pima Indian Diabetes ({PID}) dataset, which comprises 768 samples with two classes (diabetes or non-diabetes) and eight continuous attributes. The use of this algorithm resulted in an average accuracy of 83.83\% after 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation. Sampling Re-{RX} with J48 graft achieved substantially better accuracy and provided a considerably fewer average number of rules and antecedents than the original Re-{RX} algorithm. These results suggest that sampling Re-{RX} with J48graft provides more accurate, concise, and interpretable extracted rules than previous algorithms, and is therefore more suitable for medical decision making, including the diagnosis of T2DM.},

We analyzed the incidence, prevalence, and burden of suffering of diabetes mellitus based on epidemiological data from the Global Burden of Disease ({GBD}) current dataset from the Institute of Health Metrics, Seattle. Global and regional trends from 1990 to 2017 of type 2 diabetes for all ages were compiled. Forecast estimates were obtained using the {SPSS} Time Series Modeler. In 2017, approximately 462 million individuals were affected by type 2 diabetes corresponding to 6.28\% of the world’s population (4.4\% of those aged 15–49 years, 15\% of those aged 50–69, and 22\% of those aged 70+), or a prevalence rate of 6059 cases per 100,000. Over 1 million deaths per year can be attributed to diabetes alone, making it the ninth leading cause of mortality. The burden of diabetes mellitus is rising globally, and at a much faster rate in developed regions, such as Western Europe. The gender distribution is equal, and the incidence peaks at around 55 years of age. Global prevalence of type 2 diabetes is projected to increase to 7079 individuals per 100,000 by 2030, reflecting a continued rise across all regions of the world. There are concerning trends of rising prevalence in lower-income countries. Urgent public health and clinical preventive measures are warranted.},

	abstract = {Diabetic peripheral neuropathy ({DPN}) affects ∼50\% of the 500 million people with type 2 diabetes worldwide and is considered disabling and irreversible. The current study was undertaken to assess the effect of metformin on peripheral neuropathy outcomes in type 2 diabetes. Participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 69) receiving metformin were recruited and underwent clinical assessment, peripheral nerve ultrasonography, nerve conduction studies, and axonal excitability studies. Also concurrently screened were 318 participants who were not on metformin, and 69 were selected as disease control subjects and matched to the metformin participants for age, sex, diabetes duration, {BMI}, {HbA}1c, and use of other diabetes therapies. Medical record data over the previous 20 years were analyzed for previous metformin use. Mean tibial nerve cross-sectional area was lower in the metformin group (metformin 14.1 ± 0.7 mm2, nonmetformin 16.2 ± 0.9 mm2, P = 0.038), accompanied by reduction in neuropathy symptom severity (P = 0.021). Axonal excitability studies demonstrated superior axonal function in the metformin group, and mathematical modeling demonstrated that these improvements were mediated by changes in nodal Na+and K+conductances. Metformin treatment is associated with superior nerve structure and clinical and neurophysiological measures. Treatment with metformin may be neuroprotective in {DPN}.,},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar levels. It can occur when the body does not produce enough insulin or when cells become resistant to insulin’s effects. There are two main types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2, which have different causes and risk factors. Early detection of diabetes allows for early intervention and management of the condition. This can help prevent or delay the development of serious complications associated with diabetes. Early diagnosis also allows for individuals to make lifestyle changes to prevent the progression of the disease. Healthcare systems play a vital role in the management and treatment of diabetes. They provide access to diabetes education, regular check-ups, and necessary medications for individuals with diabetes. They also provide monitoring and management of diabetes-related complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, and neuropathy. Through early detection, prevention and management programs, healthcare systems can help improve the quality of life and outcomes for people with diabetes. Current initiatives in healthcare systems for diabetes may fail due to lack of access to education and resources for individuals with diabetes. There may also be inadequate follow-up and monitoring for those who have been diagnosed, leading to poor management of the disease and lack of prevention of complications. Additionally, current initiatives may not be tailored to specific cultural or demographic groups, resulting in a lack of effectiveness for certain populations. In this study, we developed a diabetes prediction system using a healthcare framework. The system employs various machine learning methods, such as K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, deep learning, {SVM}, random forest, {AdaBoost} and logistic regression. The performance of the system was evaluated using the {PIMA} Indians Diabetes dataset and achieved a training accuracy of 82\% and validation accuracy of 80\%.},
