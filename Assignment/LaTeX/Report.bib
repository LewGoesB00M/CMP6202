	abstract = {Cardio-Vascular Diseases ({CVD}) are found to be rampant in the populace leading to fatal death. The statistics of a recent survey reports that the mortality rate is expanding due to obesity, cholesterol, high blood pressure and usage of tobacco among the people. The severity of the disease is piling up due to the above factors. Studying about the variations of these factors and their impact on {CVD} is the demand of the hour. This necessitates the usage of modern techniques to identify the disease at its outset and to aid a markdown in the mortality rate. Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining domains have a research scope with their enormous techniques that would assist in the prediction of the {CVD} priory and identify their behavioural patterns in the large volume of data. The results of these predictions will help the clinicians in decision making and early diagnosis, which would reduce the risk of patients becoming fatal. This paper compares and reports the various Classification, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep Learning models that are used for prediction of the Cardio-Vascular diseases. The survey is organized as threefold: Classification and Data Mining Techniques for {CVD}, Machine Learning Models for {CVD} and Deep Learning Models for {CVD} prediction. The performance metrics used for reporting the accuracy, the dataset used for prediction and classification, and the tools used for each category of these techniques are also compiled and reported in this survey.},

	abstract = {Brain stroke stands out as a leading cause of death, distinguishing it from common illnesses and highlighting the critical need to utilize machine learning techniques to identify symptoms. Among these techniques, the Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm emerged as the main candidate because of its optimal accuracy values. {RF} was chosen for its ensemble learning properties that optimize accuracy while simultaneously, bagging all outputs ({DT}), thus increasing its efficacy. Feature Selection, an important data analysis step, which is mainly achieved through pre-processing, aims to identify influential features and ignore less impactful features. Mutual Information serves as an important feature selection method. Specifically, the highest level of accuracy was achieved by cross-validating the test data - 10, resulting in 0.7760 without feature selection and 0.7790 with mutual information. Most of the attributes in the brain stroke dataset show relevance to the stroke disease class, but the resulting decision tree shows age as a particularly important node. So, the research results show that the selection feature (Mutual Information) can increase the accuracy of brain stroke classification, although it is not significant, namely an increase of 0.0030\%. With an increase, where there is no significant difference, it can be said that almost all the attributes contained in the brain stroke dataset used have an influence on their relevance to the stroke disease class.},

It is responsible for considerable morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. A timely diagnosis and prediction of this disease could provide patients with an opportunity to take the appropriate preventive and treatment strategies. To improve the understanding of risk factors, we predict type 2 diabetes for Pima Indian women utilizing a logistic regression model and decision tree—a machine learning algorithm. Our analysis finds five main predictors of type 2 diabetes: glucose, pregnancy, body mass index ({BMI}), diabetes pedigree function, and age. We further explore a classification tree to complement and validate our analysis. The six-fold classification tree indicates glucose, {BMI}, and age are important factors, while the ten-node tree implies glucose, {BMI}, pregnancy, diabetes pedigree function, and age as the significant predictors. Our preferred specification yields a prediction accuracy of 78.26\% and a cross-validation error rate of 21.74\%. We argue that our model can be applied to make a reasonable prediction of type 2 diabetes, and could potentially be used to complement existing preventive measures to curb the incidence of diabetes and reduce associated costs.},

However, the {ML} applications tend to be mistrusted because of their inability to show the internal decision-making process, resulting in slow uptake by end-users within certain healthcare sectors. This research delineates the use of three interpretable supervised {ML} models: Naı¨ve Bayes classiﬁer, random forest classiﬁer, and J48 decision tree models to be trained and tested using the Pima Indians diabetes dataset in R programming language. The performance of each algorithm is analyzed to determine the one with the best accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity. An assessment of the decision process is also made to improve the model. It can be concluded that a Naı¨ve Bayes model works well with a more ﬁne-tuned selection of features for binary classiﬁcation, while random forest works better with more features.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a complex disease that is increasing in prevalence around the world. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for about 90–95\% of all diagnosed adult cases of diabetes. Most present diagnostic methods for T2DM are black-box models, which are unable to provide the reasons underlying diagnosis to physicians; therefore, algorithms that can provide further insight are needed. Rule extraction can provide such explanations; however, in the medical setting, extracted rules must be not only highly accurate, but also simple and easy to understand. The Recursive-Rule {eXtraction} (Re-{RX}) algorithm is a “white-box” model that provides highly accurate classification. However, due to its recursive nature, it tends to generate more rules than other algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we propose the use of a rule extraction algorithm, Re-{RX} with J48graft, combined with sampling selection techniques (sampling Re-{RX} with J48graft) to achieve highly accurate, concise, and interpretable classification rules for the Pima Indian Diabetes ({PID}) dataset, which comprises 768 samples with two classes (diabetes or non-diabetes) and eight continuous attributes. The use of this algorithm resulted in an average accuracy of 83.83\% after 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation. Sampling Re-{RX} with J48 graft achieved substantially better accuracy and provided a considerably fewer average number of rules and antecedents than the original Re-{RX} algorithm. These results suggest that sampling Re-{RX} with J48graft provides more accurate, concise, and interpretable extracted rules than previous algorithms, and is therefore more suitable for medical decision making, including the diagnosis of T2DM.},

We analyzed the incidence, prevalence, and burden of suffering of diabetes mellitus based on epidemiological data from the Global Burden of Disease ({GBD}) current dataset from the Institute of Health Metrics, Seattle. Global and regional trends from 1990 to 2017 of type 2 diabetes for all ages were compiled. Forecast estimates were obtained using the {SPSS} Time Series Modeler. In 2017, approximately 462 million individuals were affected by type 2 diabetes corresponding to 6.28\% of the world’s population (4.4\% of those aged 15–49 years, 15\% of those aged 50–69, and 22\% of those aged 70+), or a prevalence rate of 6059 cases per 100,000. Over 1 million deaths per year can be attributed to diabetes alone, making it the ninth leading cause of mortality. The burden of diabetes mellitus is rising globally, and at a much faster rate in developed regions, such as Western Europe. The gender distribution is equal, and the incidence peaks at around 55 years of age. Global prevalence of type 2 diabetes is projected to increase to 7079 individuals per 100,000 by 2030, reflecting a continued rise across all regions of the world. There are concerning trends of rising prevalence in lower-income countries. Urgent public health and clinical preventive measures are warranted.},

	abstract = {Diabetic peripheral neuropathy ({DPN}) affects ∼50\% of the 500 million people with type 2 diabetes worldwide and is considered disabling and irreversible. The current study was undertaken to assess the effect of metformin on peripheral neuropathy outcomes in type 2 diabetes. Participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 69) receiving metformin were recruited and underwent clinical assessment, peripheral nerve ultrasonography, nerve conduction studies, and axonal excitability studies. Also concurrently screened were 318 participants who were not on metformin, and 69 were selected as disease control subjects and matched to the metformin participants for age, sex, diabetes duration, {BMI}, {HbA}1c, and use of other diabetes therapies. Medical record data over the previous 20 years were analyzed for previous metformin use. Mean tibial nerve cross-sectional area was lower in the metformin group (metformin 14.1 ± 0.7 mm2, nonmetformin 16.2 ± 0.9 mm2, P = 0.038), accompanied by reduction in neuropathy symptom severity (P = 0.021). Axonal excitability studies demonstrated superior axonal function in the metformin group, and mathematical modeling demonstrated that these improvements were mediated by changes in nodal Na+and K+conductances. Metformin treatment is associated with superior nerve structure and clinical and neurophysiological measures. Treatment with metformin may be neuroprotective in {DPN}.,},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar levels. It can occur when the body does not produce enough insulin or when cells become resistant to insulin’s effects. There are two main types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2, which have different causes and risk factors. Early detection of diabetes allows for early intervention and management of the condition. This can help prevent or delay the development of serious complications associated with diabetes. Early diagnosis also allows for individuals to make lifestyle changes to prevent the progression of the disease. Healthcare systems play a vital role in the management and treatment of diabetes. They provide access to diabetes education, regular check-ups, and necessary medications for individuals with diabetes. They also provide monitoring and management of diabetes-related complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, and neuropathy. Through early detection, prevention and management programs, healthcare systems can help improve the quality of life and outcomes for people with diabetes. Current initiatives in healthcare systems for diabetes may fail due to lack of access to education and resources for individuals with diabetes. There may also be inadequate follow-up and monitoring for those who have been diagnosed, leading to poor management of the disease and lack of prevention of complications. Additionally, current initiatives may not be tailored to specific cultural or demographic groups, resulting in a lack of effectiveness for certain populations. In this study, we developed a diabetes prediction system using a healthcare framework. The system employs various machine learning methods, such as K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, deep learning, {SVM}, random forest, {AdaBoost} and logistic regression. The performance of the system was evaluated using the {PIMA} Indians Diabetes dataset and achieved a training accuracy of 82\% and validation accuracy of 80\%.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus, generally known as diabetes, is one of the most common diseases worldwide. It is a metabolic disease characterized by insulin deﬁciency, or glucose (blood sugar) levels that exceed 200 mg/{dL} (11.1 ml/L) for prolonged periods, and may lead to death if left uncontrolled by medication or insulin injections. Diabetes is categorized into two main types—type 1 and type 2—both of which feature glucose levels above “normal,” deﬁned as 140 mg/{dL}. Diabetes is triggered by malfunction of the pancreas, which releases insulin, a natural hormone responsible for controlling glucose levels in blood cells. Diagnosis and comprehensive analysis of this potentially fatal disease necessitate application of techniques with minimal rates of error. The primary purpose of this research study is to assess the potential role of machine learning in predicting a person’s risk of developing diabetes. Historically, research has supported the use of various machine algorithms, such as naïve Bayes, decision trees, and artiﬁcial neural networks, for early diagnosis of diabetes. However, to achieve maximum accuracy and minimal error in diagnostic predictions, there remains an immense need for further research and innovation to improve the machine-learning tools and techniques available to healthcare professionals. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel cloud-based machine-learning fusion technique involving synthesis of three machine algorithms and use of fuzzy systems for collective generation of highly accurate ﬁnal decisions regarding early diagnosis of diabetes.},

Having the suitable training set size is an important factor for the classification model’s generalization performance. The main goal of this study is to find the appropriate training set size for three pre-trained networks using different custom datasets. For this aim, the study presented in this paper explores the effect of varying the train / test split ratio on the performance of three popular pre-trained models, namely {MobileNetV}2, {ResNet}50v2 and {VGG}19, with a focus on image classification task. In this work, three balanced datasets never seen by the models have been used, each containing 1000 images divided into two classes. The train / test split ratios used for this study are: 60-40, 70-30, 80-20 and 90-10. The focus was on the critical metrics of sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy to evaluate the performance of the classifiers under the different ratios. Experimental results show that, the performance of the classifiers is affected by varying the training / testing split ratio for the three custom datasets. Moreover, with the three pretrained models, using more than 70\% of the dataset images for the training task gives better performance.},

This research investigates the impact of varying train-test split ratios on machine learning model performance and generalization capabilities using the {BraTS} 2013 dataset. Logistic regression, random forest, k nearest neighbors, and support vector machines were trained with split ratios ranging from 60:40 to 95:05. Findings reveal significant variations in accuracies across these ratios, emphasizing the critical need to strike a balance to avoid overfitting or underfitting. The study underscores the importance of selecting an optimal train-test split ratio that considers tradeoffs such as model performance metrics, statistical measures, and resource constraints. Ultimately, these insights contribute to a deeper understanding of how ratio selection impacts the effectiveness and reliability of machine learning applications across diverse fields.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Diabetes has been a disease of public health concern for a number of decades. It was in the 1930s when scientists made an interesting discovery that the disease is actually divided into two types as some patients were insensitive to insulin treatment then. Type 2 Diabetes which happens to be the non-insulin dependent one is the most common form of the disease and is caused by the interaction between genetic and non-genetic factors. Despite conflicting results, numerous studies have identified genetic and non-genetic factors associated with this common type of diabetes. This review has summarized literature on some genes and non-genetic factors which have been identified to be associated with Type 2 diabetes. It has sourced literature from {PubMed}, Web of Science and Medline without any limitation to regions, publication types, or languages. The paper has started with the introduction, the play of non-genetic factors, the impact of genes in general, and ended with the interaction between some genes and environmental factors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Recent developments in machine learning allow for flexible functional form estimation beyond the approaches typically used by survey researchers and social scientists. Support vector machines ({SVMs}) are one such technique, commonly used for binary classification problems, such as whether or not an individual decides to participate in a survey. Since their inception, {SVMs} have been extended to solve categorical classification and regression problems. Their versatility in combination with the fact that they perform well in the presence of a large number of predictors, even with a small number of cases, makes them very appealing for a wide range of problems, including character recognition and text classification, speech and speaker verification, as well as imputation problems and record linkage. In this article, we provide a non-technical introduction to the main concepts of {SVMs}, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, present ideas as to how they can be used in survey research, and, finally, provide a hands-on example, including code, as to how they can be used in survey research and how the results compare to a traditional logistic regression.},

	abstract = {Noise in data is an effective cause of concern for many machine learning techniques that are used in modeling data. Researchers have studied the impact of noise only on some particular learning algorithm, but only very few attempted to analyze the effect of noise on different ones. In this work, we study the noise sensitivity of four different learning algorithms under different intensities of noise. Particularly, we compare the noise sensitivity of decision tree, naïve bayes, support vector machine, and logistic regression. The algorithms are tested on different datasets that are artificially injected with different degrees of noise. The study helps us understand the impact of different levels of noise on the learning algorithms mentioned above. Furthermore, it also guides of choosing the learning algorithms. In general, naïve bayes is the most resistant to noise. However, it performs also the worst. The other algorithms perform much better than naïve bayes especially after the noisy level is lower than 40\%. When we have approaches to improve the data quality (reduce the noise level), decision tree is the most preferred one, followed by support vector machine and logistic regression, not naïve bayes.},

	abstract = {The research seeks to offer valuable insights and references for the prediction of thyroid illness, with a particular focus on accuracy assessment. Through a comprehensive examination, it evaluates the efficacy of three commonly utilized machine learning ({ML}) algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors ({KNN}), Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression. This analysis not only investigates their performance but also elucidates their utilization as classification tools within the context of thyroid disease prediction. Emphasizing the simplicity and effectiveness of logistic regression, especially in binary outcome prediction tasks, the abstract underscores its significance. Decision trees are described as versatile instruments with a hierarchical decision-making structure adaptable for various classification and regression tasks. In contrast, {KNN} simplifies supervised learning by categorizing new instances based on their similarity to existing ones, ensuring consistency in predictions. In my research, I have developed and applied three distinct algorithms. Notably, the decision tree algorithm exhibited the most promising performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 99 \%. Additionally, the logistic regression model demonstrated an accuracy of 88\%, while the K-nearest neighbors ({KNN}) approach yielded a respectable accuracy of 93 \%. Leveraging the thyroid dataset from the {UC} Irvine Finding Knowledge in Databases Archive, this research aims to advance the understanding of thyroid disease prediction methodologies while contributing to improved assessment practices. By providing insights into these {ML} techniques, the study endeavors to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of thyroid illness prediction models, ultimately benefiting clinical decision-making and patient care.},
